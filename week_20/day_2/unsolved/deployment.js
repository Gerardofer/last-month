//ALSO USE create-express-react to get both package.JSON on the client and the server side.

//Create the repo
//FIRST RUN YARN BUILD - this will create the files and build folder that will eventually get uploaded to the cloent side.

//THEN, CREATE THE mlab DATABASE - this will allow you to have a database for the app

//-----------  on the terminal  -------------
// $ heroku create
// $ git push heroku master

//if I want to updload the seed that was made for the app, I can run this command on the terminal
